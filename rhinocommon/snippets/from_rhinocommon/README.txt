These are the .net samples from src4/DotNetSDK/rhinocommon/examples. They need
to be merged into the directory above. See compare.txt for a quick and dirty
matching of the samples extracted from devdocs with those in this directory.
To create compare.txt I converted the new something-cool.cs naming scheme into
the old ex_somethingcool.cs format and the diff'ed all the .cs files. If there
isn't a "+" at the start of the line then the new style filename should be
easily decipherable. For those that had no match (lines starting with "+") I
took a quick first pass at trying to match them up manually. Good luck.
