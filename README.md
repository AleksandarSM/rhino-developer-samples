# Rhino Developer Samples

This repository contains all the sample developer code for programming in the Rhino and Grasshopper ecosystem.

The source of this repository will be used to populate the [Samples](http://developer.rhino3d.com/samples/) section of the [Rhino Developer website](http://developer.rhino3d.com/).

Much like the Rhino Developer website, the version of Rhino that these samples are compatible with are determined by which branch of this repository one is viewing:

- The `master` branch corresponds to the current, stable, shipping version of Rhino (currently Rhino 5).
- The `wip` branch corresponds to the version of Rhino currently in active development (currently Rhino 6).
- Older versions of Rhino will be broken out into version-specific branches (for example: `5`).

## Samples by SDK or Language

The samples in this repository are organized by folders that correspond to the different SDKs that make up the Rhino development platform.  For more information about the different Rhino SDKs and supported languages, please see the [Rhino Developer website](http://developer.rhino3d.com/).  This repository contains samples for:
