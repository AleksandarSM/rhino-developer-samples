# Rhino Developer Samples

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/mcneel/developer-rhino3d-com/blob/master/images/dev-logo-rhino-small.png">

This repository contains all the sample developer code for programming in the Rhino and Grasshopper ecosystem.

The source of this repository will be used to populate the [Samples](http://developer.rhino3d.com/samples/) section of the [Rhino Developer website](http://developer.rhino3d.com/).

Much like the Rhino Developer website, the version of Rhino that these samples are compatible with are determined by which branch of this repository one is viewing:

- The `master` branch corresponds to the current, stable, shipping version of Rhino (currently Rhino 5).
- The `wip` branch corresponds to the version of Rhino currently in active development (currently Rhino 6).
- Older versions of Rhino will be archived into version-specific branches (for example: `5`).

## Samples by SDK or Language

The samples in this repository are organized by folders that correspond to the different SDKs that make up the Rhino development platform.
