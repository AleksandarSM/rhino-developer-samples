# RhinoScript Samples

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/mcneel/developer-rhino3d-com/blob/master/images/rhinoscript-logo.png" width="400">

This folder contains all the sample scripts for RhinoScript, the VBScript-based scripting language for Rhino for Windows.

Much like the Rhino Developer website, the version of Rhino that these samples are compatible with are determined by which branch of this repository one is viewing:

- The `master` branch corresponds to the current, stable, shipping version of Rhino.
- The `wip` branch corresponds to the version of Rhino currently in active development.
- Older versions of Rhino will be archived into version-specific branches (for example: `5`).

## Running Samples

To run the RhinoScript samples, you are going to need:

* [Rhino 5 for Windows](http://www.rhino3d.com/download)
